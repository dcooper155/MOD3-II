I'm Dave Cooper
I'm a complex adaptive systems "social" scientist
My background is in organizational change
I don't want to make changes to the Python code. I'm at the extent of what I can do. I could add some simple code for graphs, but for now I will leave it as is. Hence, I'm simply creating some new files in Github within our shared repository. 
Also, I've looked at the code here in Github, but I have no idea how to edit it--not safely, anyway.
